# IASkins Plugin for Minecraft Spigot Servers

This plugin allows server admins to create customizable "skin items" which when applied to "base items" combine to
create "skinned items."

## Features

- Convert default Minecraft items into uniquely skinned items.
- Retain the item's current durability level, enchantments, title (if any), and lore after skinning.
- Skins are automatically removed and returned to the player if the item breaks or if the player dies.

## Planned Features:

- Turn off the "keep skins" feature on death or item breakage in configuration.
- Permission nodes per skinned item.

## Installation

Note: This plugin requires ItemsAdder to be installed on your server. You can purchase
ItemsAdder [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/✨itemsadder⭐emotes-mobs-items-armors-hud-gui-emojis-blocks-wings-hats-liquids.73355/updates).

1. Download the jar file.
2. Drop the jar file into your server's plugin directory.
3. Start or restart your server.

After these steps, an 'IASkins' folder will be generated containing a pre-made YAML file with pre-configured skins and
their resulting skinned items.

## Usage

There are two ways to apply skins:

**Command:**

1. Hold the skin in your player's offhand and the item to be skinned in their main hand.
2. Use the command `/applyskin` or `/skin` in the console.

**Vanilla Anvil:**

You can also use the vanilla anvil to apply skins.

To remove a skin, use the `/unskin` command.
